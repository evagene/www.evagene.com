### Evagene's genetic model grows to meet your needs

Evagene is so much more than the best pedigree diagramming tool. The underlying records closely mirror biological structures and events giving you much greater flexibility in how you manage your information.

No data is "hard-coded" or deeply ingrained - as you develop or acquire new penetrance tables or ethnicity data, Evagene can take it on board and even retrospectively apply it to any of your existing pedigrees.

Evagene can learn about diseases, chromosomes and any data you can imagine, and how that information applies to patients and pedigrees
