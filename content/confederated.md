## WE ALREADY HAVE A DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMME

Big data and machine learning projects are, unsurprisingly, a huge growth area in many organisations. The benefits on offer, in terms of increased margins, lower costs, greater reliability and the opening of new opportunities cannot be ignored.  Your business may have grown from judgement-based to evidence-based decisions and quite recently taken the step into leading through predictive models. The next stage of the journey is automated machine learning, expediting the journey from business objective to active solution and providing a platform to scale.

Automating some or all of your machine learning pipeline will help you to concentrate your data science resources on their highest-value tasks in a virtuous circle of competitive advantage.

[Forbes declared Data Scientist as the top job of 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/09/the-6-top-data-jobs-in-2018/), attracting top salaries and high job satisfaction.  The competition for skilled data scientists is fierce. [According to KDNuggets, two thirds of data scientists will stick it out with an employer for no more than four years](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/09/how-long-data-scientists-stay-jobs.html), and four in every ten are gone within 24 months. Keeping in mind that industry experts suggest a successful predictive modelling project may take 12 months to reach production, the resource pool of data scientists is a real impediment to growing your big data programme.

And what happens to all of that working knowledge they have leave? It exits your organisation and is carried with them to their next job.  Automated machine learning protects your intellectual property and enables growth by redirecting the role of data scientists away from the repetitive and towards high-value activities around understanding the problem domain and the data itself and, ultimately, deliver more of your projects into production and more value to your business.

Allied Machine Learning will work with you to deliver automation across your data science pipeline so that you can work through your backlog rapidly, efficiently and transparently. Robotising your processes frees up the precious data science resource to concentrate on "squeezing the pips", overseeing and stretching the value from each stage.
